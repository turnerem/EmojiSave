# Amount spent
- Add third column for amount
- This value lives in another DB that has three fields: cat (id), jsDate, amount
- Default value of 0
- Maybe this is where graphQl can come into its own. Will it allow me to pull out data and sum fields by day, etc?
- Want to be able to add amount spent (at initial setup too?) with default time of expendture of present

# Emphasis
- emoji on LHS, emo description on RHS, because description supports emoji and not other way round.
- on other pages, only emoji will be used
